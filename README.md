## Why?

To showcase `fields` in a basic Phoenix App a complete beginner can understand in 5 minutes.

## What?

A _tiny_ demo/example app using `fields` to store an "event participant registration form"
that uses as many of the `fields` as possible in real-world ways. 

## Who?

This is aimed at people getting started with `fields`,
both `@dwyl` and the wider `Elixir` community.

# How?

Run the demo on your computer!

## 1. Clone from `GitHub`

Clone the project from `GitHub`:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:dwyl/fields-demo.git
```

## 2. Setup Dependencies & Database

Setup the project on `localhost`:

```sh
mix setup
```

## 3. Run the App

Run the app:

```sh
mix s
```

Open the app in your browser,
you should expect to see:

# TODO: add GIF of inputting data.


# Build Log

This is a comprehensive step-by-step log 
of everything we did when creating this demo app.
If you feel we have skipped a step
or anything is unclear,
please 
[open an issue](https://github.com/dwyl/fields-demo/issues)


## 1. Create a New Phoenix App

Create a New Phoenix App:

```sh
mix phx.new fields_demo --no-mailer --no-dashboard --no-gettext
```

> **Note**: We don't need to send email, have a fancy dashboard or translation. 


## 2. Setup Coverage

So we know which files are covered by tests,
we setup coverage following the steps outlined in:
[/dwyl/phoenix-chat-example#13-what-is-not-tested](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-chat-example#13-what-is-not-tested)

> **Note**: This is the _first_ thing 
> we add to all new `Elixir/Phoenix` projects
because it lets us see what is _not_ being tested. ðŸ™ˆ
It's just a good engineering discipline/habit to get done; a 
[hygiene factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_theory)
like brushing your teeth. ðŸª¥

With that setup we can now run:

```sh
mix c
```

We see output similar to the following:

```sh
.....
Finished in 0.07 seconds (0.03s async, 0.04s sync)
5 tests, 0 failures

----------------
```

Not great. 
But most of the untested code is in:
`lib/fields_demo_web/components/core_components.ex`
which we aren't going to _use_ in this project ...

### 2.1 Ignore Unused "System" Files

Create a file with called `coveralls.json`
and add the following contents:

```json
{
  "coverage_options": {
    "minimum_coverage": 100
  },
  "skip_files": [
    "lib/fields_demo/application.ex",
    "lib/fields_demo_web/components/core_components.ex",
    "lib/fields_demo_web/telemetry.ex",
    "test/"
  ]
}
```
Save the file.
This sets **`100%`** coverage as our minimum/baseline
and ignores the files we aren't reaching with our tests.

Re-run:

```sh
mix c
```

And you should see the following output:

```sh
.....
Finished in 0.05 seconds (0.01s async, 0.04s sync)
5 tests, 0 failures

----------------
```

Now we can move on!

# 3. Run the Phoenix App!

Before we start adding features,
let's run the default `Phoenix` App.
In your terminal, run:

```sh
mix setup
mix phx.server
```

> **Note**: we always create an alias for `mix phx.server` as `mix s`.

With the `Phoenix` server running,
visit 
[localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
in your web browser,
you should see something similar to the following:

<img width="796" alt="image" src="https://github.com/dwyl/fields/assets/194400/891e890e-c94a-402e-baee-ee47fd3725a7">

That completes 2 minutes of "setup".
Let's add a schema!

<div align="center">

# Register for _Awesome_ Conf! 

<img width="286" alt="awesome smiley" src="https://github.com/dwyl/content/assets/194400/dc803ac9-97e9-4088-9c3d-819d0de42aec">

</div>

In this demo App 
we're going to create
a registration form
for our fictitious
**_Awesome_ Conference**.

# 4. Create `attendee` schema

The goal is to allow `people` attending **_Awesome_ Conf**
to submit the following data:

+ `first_name` - how we greet you. Will appear on your conference pass.
+ `last_name` - your family name. Will appear on you conference pass.
+ `email` - to confirm attendance
+ `phone_number`  - to verify your access when attending the secret event.
+ `address` - so we can send the welcome pack
+ `address_line_2` - if your address has multiple lines.
+ `postcode` - for the address.
+ `gender` - for venue capacity planning.
+ `dietary_preference` - for meals and snacks provided by the conference.
+ `website` - share your awesomeness and have it as a QR code on your conference pass.
+ `description` - brief description of your awesome project.
+ `feedback` - Feedback or suggestions


## 4.1 `gen.schema`

Using the 
[`mix phx.gen.live`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Mix.Tasks.Phx.Gen.Schema.html)
command, 
run: 
```sh
mix phx.gen.live Accounts Attendee attendees first_name:string last_name:string email:string --no-context
```

You should expect to see output similar to the following:

```sh
* creating lib/fields_demo_web/live/attendee_live/show.ex
* creating lib/fields_demo_web/live/attendee_live/index.ex
* creating lib/fields_demo_web/live/attendee_live/form_component.ex
* creating lib/fields_demo_web/live/attendee_live/index.html.heex
* creating lib/fields_demo_web/live/attendee_live/show.html.heex
* creating test/fields_demo_web/live/attendee_live_test.exs

Add the live routes to your browser scope in lib/fields_demo_web/router.ex:

    live "/attendees", AttendeeLive.Index, :index
    live "/attendees/new", AttendeeLive.Index, :new
    live "/attendees/:id/edit", AttendeeLive.Index, :edit

    live "/attendees/:id", AttendeeLive.Show, :show
    live "/attendees/:id/show/edit", AttendeeLive.Show, :edit
```


# FieldsDemo

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
